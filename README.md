ðŸ§  Skin Cancer Detection using TensorFlow & CNN Made by Omar Elnainay, Anas Radwan, Arsany Ehab


This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow to automatically classify skin lesion images as either benign or malignant. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model is trained on dermatology image datasets to assist in early skin cancer detection, particularly melanoma.

ðŸš€ Features
Image classification using a custom CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras

Preprocessing with data augmentation to improve model generalization

Training visualization using TensorBoard

Early stopping and model checkpointing to avoid overfitting

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Optional transfer learning with pretrained models like MobileNet or ResNet

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn for metrics
